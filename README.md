# UberSupplyDemandAnalysis
# City Supply and Demand Analysis

## Overview

Cities are hubs of demand and supply interactions for Uber. Analyzing these interactions can offer valuable insights into the company's business and planning. This project focuses on analyzing the supply and demand data, but please note that the actual data for this project is behind a paywall. In order to work on this project, synthetic data that closely resembles the real data was generated. As a result, some of the answers and visualizations may appear unconventional, but the project is designed to demonstrate the analytical process and problem-solving.

## Data Generation

Due to the unavailability of the actual dataset, random data that mimics the structure and characteristics of the real data was created for analysis.

## Project Details

The project involves answering a set of eleven questions, which include tasks like data analysis, aggregation, finding extrema, and visualizations. The questions revolve around understanding patterns in supply and demand, identifying key insights, and making data-driven decisions for Uber's operations.

## Questions

Here are the questions addressed in this project:

1. Which date had the most completed trips during the two-week period?
2. What was the highest number of completed trips within a 24-hour period?
3. Which hour of the day had the most requests during the two-week period?
4. What percentages of all zeroes during the two-week period occurred on weekends (Friday at 5 pm to Sunday at 3 am)?
5. What is the weighted average ratio of completed trips per driver during the two-week period?
6. In drafting a driver schedule in terms of 8-hour shifts, when are the busiest 8 consecutive hours over the two-week period in terms of unique requests?
7. True or False: Driver supply always increases when demand increases during the two-week period.
8. In which 72-hour period is the ratio of Zeroes to Eyeballs the highest?
9. If you could add 5 drivers to any single hour of every day during the two-week period, which hour should you add them to?
10. True or False: There is exactly two weeks of data in this analysis.
11. Looking at the data from all two weeks, which time might make the most sense to consider a true "end day" instead of midnight?

## Note

Please keep in mind that while the approach used in this project closely simulates a real-world analysis, the generated data may result in answers or visualizations that seem unconventional or unexpected. This project is meant for demonstration and practice purposes.

## Getting Started

You can clone this repository to access the project code and data. To run the analysis and answer the questions, you will need Python and relevant libraries installed.

## Acknowledgments

This project was created for practice and educational purposes, inspired by real-world scenarios and questions related to supply and demand analysis.

**Please Note:** This project does not use real Uber data, and it is meant for educational purposes only.
